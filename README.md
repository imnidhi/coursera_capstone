# Applied Data Science Capstone
### 1) Introduction / Business Problem
The idea of this project is to help new residents to plan whether they want to build a house in a specific locality by choosing the location on the basis of proximity of schools,hospitals,malls,population density present in Toronto.
The project aims to provide people with information regarding the number of schools,hospitals etc in the neighbourhood mentioned by the user.
### 2) Data Prepping
To provide the residents with appropriate data I will be using Foursquare API to find nearby schools,hospitals etc along with Toronto Neighbourhoods shapefile for the population density.
#### Toronto's Census data is publicly available at this website:
