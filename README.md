# Applied Data Science Capstone
### 1) Introduction / Business Problem
The idea of this project is to help new residents to plan whether they want to build a house in a specific locality by choosing the location on the basis of proximity of schools,hospitals,malls,population present in that region.
### 2) Data Prepping
To provide the residents with appropriate data I will be using Foursquare API to find nearby schools,hospitals etc along with Toronto Neighbourhoods shapefile for the population.
#### Toronto's Census data is publicly available at this website:
